Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

A man who invented the 20th century
When a woman reaches a certain age, she gets a seasoned perspective on her own desires. She realizes that the most important benefit of her sexuality isn't security, wealth or status... but the lustful pleasure of deep, hard ass reaming! That's when veteran French director David Perry and his crew of well-hung butt bandits come to the rescue. David's latest, Assfucked MILFs 3, gives mature European ladies exactly what they crave most huge, hard cocks expanding their rectums. Classy Czech beauty Cindy Dollar, her long, shapely legs in sheer nylons, calls up Mike Angelo and invites him over for a passionate session of anal intercourse and ass-to-mouth cocksucking that leaves Cindy's mouth brimming with semen. Next, the director visits athletic blonde babe Mandy Paradise, who takes a sensual shower, masturbates with an anal toy and submits to David's thick shaft. She rides until her asshole is agape and sucks hot cum from his spurting penis head. Busty, tattooed Kayla Green takes a three-way dicking from David and his pal Sabby. After she loosens herself up with a dildo, the boys bang Kayla in every hole, even stuffing her from both ends in a lewd double-penetration. Thick, meaty mama Lara Latex fingers her phat, juicy ass and shaved pussy before getting her butthole plowed by real-life husband Jim Slip. Lara's amazing booty gets the ferocious fucking it truly deserves. Assfucked MILFs 3 is tailor-made for fans of experienced females and seekers of explicit anal fun.

Sure, Rocco Siffredi is an esteemed director and celebrated porn performer who's made hundreds of high-end, big-budget smut films. But threes just no substitute for the intimacy of one girl, one man and one camera. Rocco's POV 12 brings the Italian studs unique style into sharp focus as gorgeous young ladies visit him in his private office for some intensive auditions. These fresh, alluring girls are horny, willing and brimming with curiosity. First, sexy Jane services Rocco's huge shaft, sucking and fucking him and slurping up his cum. Next, 20-year-old Hungarian music student Connie meets the older man and shows him her perfect, petite body and sunny smile. The raven-haired cutie gags on his massive cock and rides Rocco until he spews a hot load of jizz into her hungry mouth. Adorable, athletic Dori plays with big dildos, then bounces on Rocco's meat, completely stuffed with throbbing Italian sausage. Stunning, all-natural Ivett is a beautiful student who takes direction well; she rides Rocco and sucks his sperm directly from the source. Finally, slender and sassy Ariella blows Rocco... but struggles mightily to fit the directors thick tool inside her. This kind of honest, real sex only happens behind closed doors. For those who appreciate the personal touch, Rocco's POV 12 presents a candid look at a porn studs (almost) private reality.

French pervert extraordinaire Christoph Clark is experienced at finding gorgeous, young Euro angels who enjoy performing the nastiest of sexual acts. Now that he's working in front of the camera again, the veteran director is ready to test their talents firsthand! "Angel Perverse 23" consists of four scenes of anal perversity with insanely beautiful girls, and every one stars Christoph's stunning and erotically inventive petite brunette protege Abbie Cat. This luscious creature starts the fun in the kitchen, tempting Christoph into a morning session of POV cocksucking, anal reaming and ATM hi-jinks. The sultry nymph cleans the director's asshole with her eager tongue and strokes him with her pretty bare soles, eventually getting a faceful of cum. Next, dark-haired teen Anastasia Brill has a three-way with Abbie and Christoph. The stocking-clad cutie rubs Christoph's cock with her nyloned feet and takes his stiff member up her butt while Abbie laps Anastasia's shaved pussy and sucks Christoph ass-to-mouth. Out in the city street, Abbie leads slender blonde Nataly Von to an underground parking garage, where waits her perverted friend Christoph. Nataly and Abbie give a double blow job; Christoph pushes the young sluts against the concrete wall to fuck them from behind. He brings both girls home for a filthy scene of anal rimming, orgasmic foot play and twisted buttfuckery. Finally, Christoph and his lovely partner spoil big-assed, all-natural teenager Bettina DiCapri with a hot threesome of relentless anal reaming, leaving sweet Bettina's ass gaping widely. It's hotter than hell when angels are perverse.

A pair of studs appears, and they invade each of Thalia's inputs, fucking her rectum and pussy at the same time. The dick-drunk whore sucks cock ass-to-mouth and swallows two servings of hot jizz. Classic slut Maria Bellucci warms up her c**t and asshole using a clear phallus, then takes on two big-dicked dudes who relentlessly bone Maria's butt and gullet before cum-splattering her face. Maria's anus is left red and battered. Next up is gorgeous, spunky Rebecca, a shorthaired, all-natural slut wearing hoop earrings, striped leggings and platform boots. Rebecca cheerfully gets her face brutally fucked and her bunghole reamed until it gapes open lewdly. She's double-penetrated, she sucks huge cocks ass-to-mouth like a true champ, and she gulps down two creamy loads with a winning smile. Blonde stunner Avril is a real-life beauty with huge, wide nipples and a big, cushy rump that takes all manner of abuse from the two cocksmen assigned to her case. They thoroughly bang Avril's mouth and ass, and her sphincter yawns wide. Avril compliantly consumes a large helping of ball-butter. Adrianna's a big-lipped, round-assed blonde slattern in yellow spike-heeled boots. She gets a two-man train run on her mouth and rear end, with double penetration and ATM fun, and takes a messy dual cum facial. Last but not least, nasty brunette Cory Baby teases us in a sports bra and panties, fingering her own butthole and licking the digit clean. She uses a toy to fill her holes, then helps out a duo of ass-fucking miscreants who vigorously ream her out and decorate Cory's face with goo.

6 scenes of gorgeous cock hungry sluts getting their assholes made into cavernous chasms of sex stank.
Europe teems with wayward teen waifs hopeful of starring in sex films, so Cruel Media separates the sluts from the wannabes. "Anal Attack 9" showcases neophyte nymphs with the infamous "Cruel Cock Mafia" in six scenes of anal debauchery. Julia and Nikoletta make out, play with glass toys and take on two studs before modeling matching cum facials. Nikoletta gets sodomized, then joins natural-bodied, blue-eyed redhead Bernadetta for side-by-side anal reamings. Both buttholes gape; cum fills both mouths; the girls swallow semen and share a cum kiss. Shorthaired bleach-blonde Tanya opens up her backdoor with a red butt plug, then welcomes two brawny dudes to cock-stuff her holes. The big puds dwarf her little body, leaving her butthole gaping angry red and her mouth creamed. Adorable Karina's skimpy skivvies almost disappear up her tanned butt crack. A vigorous butt-fuck on the tile floor leads to a load of sperm for Karina's mouth and face. Lisa Sparkle's black hair, dark eyes and flappy titties entice a rousing fuck from two horny cocks. The best part is the double-penetration mauling that leaves her lower holes happily exhausted. A double-facial leaves her a spunk-splattered mess. Lucy, a fetching green-eyed blonde with the natural tits, pries a glass plug up her rear, rides a prick hard and blushes red as she orgasms. Lube leaks from her gaping anus when the pounding subsides. Having proven themselves with the Cruel Cock Mafia, the girls of Anal Attack 9 are ready for the fucking world.

Because nothing in a young woman's life could be more poignant than her anal gaping debut, ass-crazed director Omar Galanti initiates his favorite starlets with colon-expanding sessions of hard-core rectal pounding. In First Gape Experience, the notorious Italian pervert buggers a bevy of beautiful, all-natural Russian models, stretching their virgin buttholes with his massive, menacing prick until their bungholes yawn widely for the first time. Soft, sexy Bella Marchelli receives a blindfolded mouth-fuck, then takes the directors giant cock up her plush, round bottom till her sphincter dilates. Bella slurps his thick tool ass-to-mouth, and her pretty face ends up dripping messy sperm. Next, dick-starved, fishnet-clad harlot Suzanna Scott gets her fleshy rump reamed by the beefy bald stud. Omar opens her rectal cavity with phallic toys and thrusts his veiny cock deep into Suzanna's bowels in a passionate introduction to the joys of asshole wreckage. Slim, petite brunette Lizaveta K. orally worships his meaty tool, rides Omar's fat shaft and gets her flat tummy splattered with spunk. Up steps Branda Hally, an ultra-skinny girl with a hairy pussy; she can take plenty of slapping, deep-throat face fucking and anal plunging. Omar punishes Branda's booty, loosening it with dildos and his giant dick, and pulls the kinky sluts mouth open for his cum with a dental spreader! An anal whore never forgets her first time, and after these stunning young women have graduated from Omar Galanti's First Gape Experience, there's no going back sex will never be normal again!

Age Is A State Of Mind
An Béal Bocht is set in Corca Dhorcha, (Corkadorkey), a remote region of Ireland where it never stops raining and everyone lives in desperate poverty (and always will) while talking in "the learned smooth Gaelic". It is a memoir of one Bónapárt Ó Cúnasa, a resident of this region, beginning at his very birth. At one point the area is visited by hordes of Dublin Gaeilgeoirí (Irish language lovers), who explain that not only should one always speak Irish, but also every sentence one utters should be about the language question. However, they eventually abandon the area because the poverty is too poor, the authenticity too authentic and the Gaelicism too Gaelic. The narrator, after a series of bloodcurdling adventures, is eventually sent to prison on a false murder charge, and there, "safe in jail and free from the miseries of life",[4] has the chance to write this most affecting memoir of our times.

For lewd lesbian licking performed by glamorous European sluts, go to the master: old-school French director Christoph Clark. In his latest production, the bluntly titled Suck My C**t #2, Christoph has lovingly assembled five sizzling scenes of classy c*t-sucking action starring nine of the most beautiful young ladies in the business. These stunning bitches may look like supermodels, but they're dirty in the head eager to lick pussy, eat ass and relentlessly drill one another using big, invasive dildos. The all-natural babes in this festival of girl-on-girl lust crave the orgasmic release only another gorgeous woman can provide. Black-haired beauty Denise Sky and frisky blonde Tracy Lindsay are stuck inside on a rainy day, but they pass the time with big phallic toys and plenty of sweet cunnilingus. Slender, petite, exhibitionistic Alexis Brill and foxy Adriana cum together using every trick in the book, topped off with a passionate kiss. Raven-haired Nia Black and blonde Angie Koks moan loudly as they help each other achieve climax. Tracy returns to get serviced by her lovely slave, shapely brunette Athina. They take turns fingering pussy holes and invading one another with their trusty fake dicks. Black-haired Betty and auburn-tressed cutie-pie Hannah Sweet are horny darlings dolled up in skimpy booty shorts. The pretty baby-dykes writhe on the bed, locked in a pussy-mashing scissor fuck and grinding together in ecstasy. Suck My C**t #2 lets exquisite girls share the pleasures of Sapphic discovery.

The Movie That Will Have Couples Running Away From the Altar!
The Peterson family is on the verge of a meltdown, until their dog goes missing...
Italian performer/director Omar Galanti brings his freaky sensibilities and club-like cock to the double-DVD "Born To Be Sluts", a half-dozen marathon scenes starring six depraved, preternaturally horny young adventurers who get off on debasing themselves without inhibition. When Omar emerges from a courthouse (somehow) acquitted of promoting anal sex, he invites pretty Channel 69 journalist Henessy to interview him at his office. She gets the news, anal toys, deep-throat face fucking and a sweaty, male-dominant butt fuck. Omar and Markus Tynai manhandle Michelle, a promiscuous brunette with broad BJ lips. She sucks cock pulled freshly from her gaping asshole. Michelle takes a double-anal plowing ... two cocks up her ass at once! Omar catches long-haired Kitty Black unaware as she stuffs her c*nt and ass with a dildo. He makes her suck his big bone through her stockings, spanks her ass rosy and fucks her anus to gaping. He kisses her jism-dripping mouth! Watching porn in her apartment, cute Geizer spots Markus peeping in her window and jacking off. She's the kind of slut who invites perverts in. He carry-fucks her gaping butthole. Wendy resembles Belladonna with her sexy, gap-toothed smile and her sexual playfulness. She takes DP, double-vaginal and double-anal poundings. Buxom, tanned temptress Piksi likes clothespins affixed to her mouth, tits and pussy lips, and on Omar's scrotum and prick! Her butthole gapes and she sucks cock ATM-style before a sperm shower. Practice and determination go only so far; the nastiest sluts were born with natural talent.
